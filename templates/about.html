      <p>Hi there! Welcome to Project Exchange. We are a team of young people,
        coming together to make cultural exchange more accessible for students
        around the world. </p>
      <p>Todayâ€™s most pressing problemsâ€“from climate change to the breakdown of
        democracy to the governance of emerging technologiesâ€“are global problems.
        We believe that cross-cultural education is key to helping young peopleâ€¦ </p>
      <ol>
        <li>ðŸ—£ Engage in dialogue to better understand why othersâ€™ believe what they
          believe, and why they believe what they believe.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¡ Synthesize different bodies of knowledge and lived experiences to
          generate creative solutions to important problems.</li>
        <li>ðŸš€ Broaden their worldview, and in the process, raise their
          ambitions and connect with opportunities to pursue their goals.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our vision is to create a world where people understand each other, and
        are working together to make the world better. From 2018-2023, we ran a
        variety of <a href="/work.html">programs</a> that brought over 2,000
        high school students from 70+ countries together. Our flagship initiative
        was a 12-week Digital Exchange Program, complete with online host families,
        language learning, and workshops on topics like design thinking,
        community journalism, and the UN SDGs.</p>
      <p>As of May 2023, we are no longer running active programs. Weâ€™re
        especially glad to have been able to serve students through digital
        exchange at the height of COVID-19 (we were in full operations mode!).
        Our team is now taking some time to research, prototype, and explore new
        directions for what we want to build next. If youâ€™ve been impacted by
        our work, have ideas for what you want to see, or simply want to say hi,
        please <a href="/contact.html">drop us a note</a>!</p>
